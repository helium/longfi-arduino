We value contributions from the community and will do everything we
can go get them reviewed in a timely fashion. If you have code to send
our way or a bug to report:

* **Contributing Code**: If you have new code or a bug fix, fork this
  repo, create a logically-named branch, and [submit a PR against this
  repo](https://github.com/helium/longfi-arduino). Include a
  write up of the PR with details on what it does.

* **Formatting Code**: Please apply clang-format to any PRs. From the
  root of the repository: 
	`find . -regex '.*\.\(cpp\|hpp\|cu\|c\|h\|ino\)' -exec clang-format -i {} \;`

* **Reporting Bugs**: Open an issue [against this
  repo](https://github.com/helium/longfi-arduino/issues) with as much
  detail as you can. At the very least you'll include steps to
  reproduce the problem.

This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for
collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the
